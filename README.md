# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Technique
- The app fetches weather info from the Openweathermap api using my personal api key
- Clicking 'Generate' fetches details for the zipcode entered
- Clicking 'Clear' clears all fields
